I present my solutions to some of the tasks in the Google Foobar
challenge. [[https://foobar.withgoogle.com/][Foobar]] is a coding challenge provided by Google. I was
invited to this challenge while I was searching about Python in
Google.

In this folder there are multiple Python scripts with their
corresponding org files. In the org files you can see the task and in
the Python file you can find the solution.

Python scripts passed the tests of Google foobar challenge. They
belong to different levels of the challenge from level one to three.
